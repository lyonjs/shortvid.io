## 🚀 How to generate local video with pnpm

Inside the repo

```console
pnpm install
```

In windows create a props with local file json, it's much easier 😊

## 🐳 How to generate local video with Docker

This project can be run using Docker. 🐳
You can either reuse an image or build your own image:

### 🖼️ Use a existing image

To generate your video, please use this command:

```
docker run -v $(pwd)/out:/usr/src/app/out -it zenika/shortvid pnpm remotion render remotion/index.tsx TalkBranded out/TalkBranded.mp4 [YOUR PARAMETERS]
```

Tips: You can copy paste your parameters directly from (shortvid.io)[https://shortvid.io/]

### 👷🏼‍♂️ Build the image

To build a image, you need to build the image:

```
docker image build -t shortvid/run .
```

Then, you can run it and you will get your video in the `out` folder:

```
docker container run -v $(pwd)/out:/usr/src/app/out  -it shortvid/run
```

The command used to create the shortvid is declared in the Dockerfile at line #13.

Please change it in order to your template with [shortvid.io](https://shortvid.io/) and create your video:

```
CMD pnpm remotion render remotion/index.tsx [YOUR PARAMETERS]
```
